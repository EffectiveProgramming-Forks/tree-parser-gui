atomist parser gui
===========================

the objective is to display, interactively, the tree parsed from various code by Atomist's [tree-path](https://github.com/atomist/tree-path) library.

clone, then 'npm install' and 'npm run build' and 'npm run start' -- it should tell you what port to hit.

select a parser (Java or Markdown), enter some text to parse, and submit. see the tree. thats as far as it is so far.
